TODO for this package:
* Create different flavors of profanity
  - profanity (default package with X-support)
  - profanity-nox (without any X-dependencies)

* profanity and libprofanity currently link against ALL
  libraries (ALWAYS, required or not)

* the shared-object library libprofanity should have a versioned
  name (e.g. libprofanity-0.5.0.so)
